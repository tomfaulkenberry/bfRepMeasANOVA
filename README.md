## Estimating Bayes factors from minimal summary statistics in RM ANOVA

This repository contains materials related to my paper "[Estimating Bayes factors from minimal summary statistics in repeated measures analysis of variance design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05569)", currently in revision.

Specifically, there are two things you might want to see here:
- the paper's source files (in the "[paper](paper/)" section)
- the simulation code (in the "[simulation](simulation/)" section)
